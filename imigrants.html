	  ( Myanmar, which borders Thailand ) 
	  and they are facing persecution by a majority Buddhist government.
		</p><br>
    
      <h5>PUSH 2</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">-The Rohingya people of Myanmar are trying to escape the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA),

    <p>These migrants are receiving help from neighbouring countries≥ that are majority muslim.</p>
    
    <p><span class="w3-tag">The reason why the other southeast asian countries won't help is because they do not criticise each other. It’s a rule of the association that myanmar and 10 other nations are in.

</span> -What agencies are working with these migrants (UNHCR: United Nations High Commission for Refugees is usually a leader in this type of situation)</p>
    
	<p><span class="w3-tag">The UN is trying to help the refugees by spreading the word to different countries  </span>
	-The united states in september 2017 has committed 32 million dollars in aid to supply refugees</p>
	
	<p><span= class="w3-tag">The US offered to have some of the Rohingya people take refuge in their country and supply aids such as: medicare , food, water and shelter. 
There has been multiple donations to the people in need. From churches to online websites and physical buildings that ask for donations. 
</span>
There are many articles on the situation of the Rohingya people but not many people even know of the country Myanmar.</p>
	
	<p><span= class="w3-tag">There is news coverage of the genocide but not many people understand how bad this is.. What the Myanmar government is doing can be called an ethnic cleansing, situations like this can be compared to those like the holocaust.. Where a specific race is being targeted, killed or pushed out of their country of origin and being discriminated against.
The situation of the Rohingya people isn't being covered as it should be. This topic is barely being covered by some major news networks. All this goes to show that you should filter what the media shows you and you should always seek
